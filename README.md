* When you clone this git, change line 110 in App.java to reflect new location of sample xml file.
```java
String filePath = "/home/kunhoko/maven/keyvault/pom_backup.xml";
```
Once you have all prerequisite information, configure app.conf
```
ClientID=<Client ID of your Service Principal>
ClientCredential=<Client Secret of your Service Principal>

```
ClientID=06d7b3f2-ce85-41ed-b5ad-4404d7aax30f
ClientCredential=XZcz3OncPV5uVOmLu32MpOBfxxYRC/2nJxYGsEaznGo=
